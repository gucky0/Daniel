thermal consistency check

#set-up - sensor

A) use 1 thermocouple with correct vol to set settings
	- use thermal: no rt, not hot, 93, 58, 5s, 30cycles - saved as "Thermocouple Testing"
	- image changes - stop, prep. save, start heating, start
	0) set settings_vol
	1) pic: sensorName_Simple, benchmark before & note water level
	2) note: pcr, mac, exp, temp, 4 data
	3) pic: benchmark after & note water level
	4) repeat 
	- data to be collected: settings info, sensorName, mac, exp, pcr, analyze x2, water_DayNo, 4data
	5)run for all thermocouple - same as A w/o step 0

B) measure: total, metal, oil, water_DayNo, glass

C) 	PPT - SensorBatch - sensorName_Simple (vol benchmark for first)
		day1: take pic labelled, run, machine number, exp number, raw pcr, take pic labelled

	excel2 - yyyymmdd_Capillary Evaluation_RX - sensorName_Simple
		day1: water level, total, glass, metal
		day2: water level
		day3: water level
	wordxNo - Themocouple_QC_Report_SensorName - 
		day1: temp1, date, water, oil
